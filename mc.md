## McMMO/Vanilla Server

* MCMMO
  * Wiki available [here](https://mcmmo.org/wiki/Main_Page)
  * One noteworthy addition is that you can repair items using a block of iron as an anvil. It will consume a block of the material that the tool/armor is made from
* EssentialsX
  * Access your Ender Chest at any time with `/ec`
  * Teleport home to your bed with `/home`
    * You can also set your spawnpoint with a bed even during the daytime.
  * Warps are named locations located throughout the map. Only mods can set warp points, but everyone can use them with `/warp <warpname>`
    * If you found something cool and would like a named warp let a mod know
  * You can request to teleport to other players using `/tpa <playername>`. The other person must accept your request using `/tpaccept` ( or `/tpdeny` to reject).
* ChestCleaner Chest Sorting
  * While looking at a chest/inventory block, `/cleaninventory` or `/cinv`
* If something doesn't work like it should, let me know.

## DREHMAL v2: PRIMÎ©RDIAL - 12k x 12k Survival/Adventure Map

* See [here](https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/drehmal-v2-prim-rdial-12k-x-12k-survival-adventure-map/) for details
* A custom Resource pack is required, which I have made available [here](https://github.com/calefrey/calefrey.github.io/blob/master/static/resource-packs/drehmal-v2.zip?raw=true).
Download the zip and place it in the resource packs folder, located at `%AppData%\.minecraft\resourcepacks`
* You need to install optifine for everything to work right. I find that `OptiFine 1.15.2 HD U G1 pre29` from the [Optifine Download Page](https://optifine.net/downloads) works better than the `-pre30` version
