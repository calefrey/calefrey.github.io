  * Warps are named locations located throughout the map. Only mods can set warp points, but everyone can use them with `/warp <warpname>`
    * If you found something cool and would like a named warp let a mod know
  * You can request to teleport to other players using `/tpa <playername>`. The other person must accept your request using `/tpaccept` ( or `/tpdeny` to reject).

* If something doesn't work like it should, let me know.
