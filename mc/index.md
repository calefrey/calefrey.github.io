# Minecraft Server

## Address: mc.freyc.xyz

## Hours of Operation

* I don't like to run the server when I'm asleep, since it's in my room.
* On at ~10AM, off at 1AM.

## Current Modpacks/Plugins

* MCMMO
  * Wiki available [here](https://mcmmo.org/wiki/Main_Page)
* EssentialsX
  * Access your Ender Chest at any time with `/ec`
  * Teleport home to your bed with `/home`
    * You can also set your spawnpoint with a bed even during the daytime.
  * Warps are named locations located throughout the map. Only mods can set warp points, but everyone can use them with `/warp <warpname>`
    * If you found something cool and would like a named warp let a mod know
  * You can request to teleport to other players using `/tpa <playername>`. The other person must accept your request using `/tpaccept` ( or `/tpdeny` to reject).

This is my first time dealing with EssentialsX and permissions so if something should work and it doesn't, DM me on discord.
